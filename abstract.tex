The Rabbit is a new technology that allows to create an Ethernet network with
low-latency, deterministic packet delivery and sub-nanosecond accuracy and
picoseconds precision synchronization. WR is based on the standards Synchronous Ethernet
and IEEE 1588-2008, PTP. Currently the synchronization of the clocks throughout
the network is achieved using WR Switches,  two-step Boundary Clocks (BC).
In this paper we describe the implementation of a Transparent Clock (TC) (both
types Peer-to-Peer and End-to-End)  based on WR Link Model and existing
hardware. 

Finally, we evaluate the suitability of the WR TCs in the Control and Timing
System for the new Antiproton and Ion Research facility (FAIR) in GSI.
