White Rabbit is a new technology that supports an Ethernet timing networks with
low-latency, deterministic packet delivery, sub-nanosecond accuracy and
picosecond precise synchronization. WR is based on the  standards 
Synchronous Ethernet, IEEE 1588-2008 and PTP. 
Currently the synchronization of clocks in the network is achieved 
by using WR Switches,  two-step Boundary Clocks (BC) using delay request-respond 
mechanism. In this paper, the author describes and evaluates the implementation  
of a WR Transparent Clock (TC) that uses the WR extension of PTP and  WR
hardware.
%Finally, we evaluate the suitability of the WR TCs in the Control and Timing
%System for the new Antiproton and Ion Research facility (FAIR) in GSI.
