% author names and affiliations
% use a multiple column layout for up to three different
% affiliations
% 
% conference papers do not typically use \thanks and this command
% is locked out in conference mode. If really needed, such as for
% the acknowledgment of grants, issue a \IEEEoverridecommandlockouts
% after \documentclass

% for over three affiliations, or if they all won't fit within the width
% of the page, use this alternative format:
% 
\author{\IEEEauthorblockN{Cesar Prados\IEEEauthorrefmark{1}
\IEEEauthorrefmark{3}}
\IEEEauthorblockA{\IEEEauthorrefmark{1}GSI,Darmstadt Germany}
\IEEEauthorblockA{\IEEEauthorrefmark{3}Technical University Darmstadt, Darmstadt Germany}
