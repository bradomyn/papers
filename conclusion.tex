\section{Conclusions and Future Work}


Conclusion-->>>






Currently the WR Switch V3 ~\cite{biblio:wrswitch} behaves as Boundary clock.
After an exhaustive examination of the WR project, the following features should be
added to the existing gateware and software (no modifications in the hardware)
for a proof of concept WR TC implementation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Peer Delay Mechanism
    \item WR TC clock behaviour
    \item Hardware process of Sync and Follow Up messages
    \item Enhanced Timestamping across TC using WR
\end{itemize}

The openness of the project \footnote{The WRS is licensed under \textit{CERN Open Hardware Licence}
~\cite{biblio:lic}  and is publicly available in the Open Hardware Repository.},
plus the amount of work already done, makes the implementation achievable with a
reasonable effort.
