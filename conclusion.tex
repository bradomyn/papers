\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

The implementation and evaluation presented in this paper, indicates that WR TCs
can provide a high performance in terms of CFE, UR and reliability.The calculation of the residency 
time and delay between clocks in a P2P should be as accurate as in WR BC, although the end-to-end 
synchronization accuracy of the WR P2P and E2E TC needs a model for an enhancement of timestamping across TC 
in order to achieve the accuracy and precision that WR offers.

Currently the WR Switch V3 ~\cite{biblio:wrswitch} behaves as BC.
After an exhaustive examination of the WR project, the following features will be
added to the existing gateware and software (no modifications in the hardware)
for a proof of concept WR TC implementation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Peer Delay Mechanism
    \item WR TC clock behaviour
    \item Enhanced timestamping across TCs using WR
\end{itemize}

The openness of the project\footnote{The WRS is licensed under \textit{CERN Open Hardware Licence}
~\cite{biblio:lic}  and is publicly available on the Open Hardware Repository.},
plus the amount of work already done, makes the implementation achievable with a
reasonable effort.
